        <li><a href="page3.html">Page 3</a></li> <!--how this whole section is working(under <ul>) is creating a list of links that you click through, I assume you copied the code so you can see for yourself-->
    </ul>
    <h2>This is my homepage</h2> <!--this stands for heading 2, this is just a second heading with more information and the 2 indicates that it is smaller, you could also make an <h1> tag to make the text bigger-->
    <p>this is all of my page 1 content</p> <!--the <p> stands for paragraph and it just some information under the heading, you can later change the font with CSS etc...-->
